### ABOUT
LunarDev is the official Lunar Developments website. It's home to all of Our projects, services, tools and more! The website itself is relatively simple, easy to navigate and User friendly. This makes it accessible to Everyone. The website has only recently just started being worked on. Lunar Developments is a small Company that specializes in social media marketing and developing cheats, exploits and hacks / mods. We also develop websites and Our own apps as well as a few other side projects. Lunar Developments was founded in 2022 and hopes to grow to be a huge success in the future.

Lunar Developments has gone through several renames in the past and has had several websites which are still up and running today. We're now focused on sticking to one singular name and creating new projects, more advanced and unique than the rest.

### PROJECTS
Below are Our current projects. While they may not be listed on Our site just yet, We're still working on them. This is to make People aware of what might be available in the future (before hand):

- Lunar SMM: A site focused on social media marketing via artificial and organic growth.
- LunarAI: An advanced AI built for all purposes (has a special twist in its development).
- LunarSnap: An Android based SnapChat modification.
- LunarCord: An Android based Discord modification as well as a custom Bot.
- LunarPatch: An Android based application that allows applying patches to apps.
- StarGaze: Our social media app for the web, Windows and Android.

### DOWNLOADS
While We only have content available for Windows and Android, there's still plenty to choose from! We have a huge library of things to try, both the original and modified versions. Here are some trending topics!

Windows:
- Avee Player
- Microsoft Office
- Spotify

Android:

### SERVICES
We have a few services available and plan to grow so We have hopefully hundreds! Here's what We have at the moment!

- Social media marketing:
  - Followers / Subscribers
  - Views
  - Likes
  - Comments
  - Shares
  - Reposts
  - Verification

- ANY site to Android app
We can convert any website into an Android based application using WebView. Very simple to do but as some don't know how, We can do it for You (for a small fee of course)!

- Playlist downloader
While there are plenty of sites our there that do this for free, We are slightly different. We have several unique options when downloading all of Your favourite music or videos in playlists. Not only are You able to download SEVERAL playlists at a time, there's a bunch of settings that You can use to enhance Your experience such as:

  - Audio SponsorBlock & pre-editing
  - Audio enhancing & fixing
  - Advanced structuring
  - Video & frame rate upscaling (up to 4K)
  - Video SponsorBlock & advert removal

  We also have an experimental feature of this service. This basically allows Us to compress videos while keeping the upscaled quality intact. While this software isn't exactly new, We've found a way to make it as fast and optimized as possible.

### TOOLS
While We currently only have a few tools available, they are still handy!

- Converters (allows converting of images, videos and audio to another format)
- Downloaders (allows downloading of audio and videos from several sources)
- Editors (advanced image, video and audio editing tools)

### PREMIUM
While We'd like to keep everything free, We have hardware that needs maintaining. To keep everything cost effective, the site is being hosted here, on GitHub. If the site gains popularity, We'll consider moving to a paid domain. Here are Our premium plans (for now):
